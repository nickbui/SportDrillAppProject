# SportDrillAppProject

This java project that me and my teammates completed for our app development class. This is a prototype of the project that was proposed at the beginning of the semester. We created UML diagrams for user cases and had multiple sprints to simiulate how a development cycle would work.
I learned how to utilize java fxml in this project to add a user interface. I also learned how to properly split code into a Model, view, and controller package to organize my code.
